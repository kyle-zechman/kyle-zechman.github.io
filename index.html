  <p>Working through this course, I have learned a great deal about time and resource management. Because of my work schedule I wasn’t able to devote enough time most weeks to this course. I would’ve done better if I had planned my weeks better and used the most of the time that I had. I work by myself during these improvements and changes but the way I handle my work has informed how I can collaborate within a team. I know that I tend to just code obsessively when I get into a mindset. Comments are more of an afterthought, so I know that I need to keep them in the front of my mind so that my team members will be informed about what I’m changing. 
I believe this course has helped me with being able to communicate to shareholders. The weekly journals that we did helped me have to explain things and talk them through in a less than technical manner. This is a good soft skill to improve upon as it is very important to the business world in general. This course has also helped my understanding of each of the different types of artifacts that I had to work on. I know more about each category than I did before, and I also know what I need to improve upon to help me grow professionally. 
My skills have improved greatly over the past eight weeks. Before this I was much more of a front end focused developer and my backend abilities were lacking. I know I still have a long way to go but I can tell that they have improved quite a bit. My software design artifact was good for getting multiple files to talk with each other which is not something I had much experience with. The database artifact was a good challenge and I look forward to continuing to improve it beyond the end of this course. In general I know more about which best practices to employ including comments and naming conventions. One area that I want to explore more is security for my database artifact. I think the login being set up the way it is could be open to vulnerabilities.
